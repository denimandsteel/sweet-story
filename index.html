          <em>&ldquo;Childhood is a special time. The world is new and almost everything is completely amazing. A Sweet Story is my contribution to all the childhoods of today. It was inspired by my own kids who, like most children, know what they like and just want it all the time! Grown ups can be so serious. Kids know the truth: Life is better when it’s sweet.&rdquo;</em> &ndash; Jono Howard, author
